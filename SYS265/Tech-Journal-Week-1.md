During this Lab using vcenter we setup an Active Directory Server, Firewall, Management Server, and setup a Windows workstation. The active directory server which was setup was no longer located on the same machine like is SYS-255. We are now using a Windows Core Server which utilizes command line only. Since there was no GUI in order to network the VM you need to use _**sconfig**_ which lets you change the different settings on the OS. Also since there was no GUI we had to install Active Directory manually through powershell utilizing the command **_Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools_**. After that we had to create a forest using the command _**Install-ADDSForest -DomainName liam.local**_.
